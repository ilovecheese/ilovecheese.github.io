    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This looks like it is <em>much</em> better than Wordpress. Also I&rsquo;ve now got my feet wet with <a href="www.github.com">Git</a> and <a href="www.ruby-lang.org">Ruby</a>.
Trying to write in Markdown failed me at first, had trouble finding software or gedit plugins. Looks like a lot of people use Vi (will tackle that later).
Currently I&rsquo;m using Eclipse with a Markdown plugin. Ruby is really fascinating to me how all the gems work. Makes me miss coding and the trill when it works as attended.
While I was in middle school I spent a lot of time in VB3 writing applications for a popular online software.
I like how <a href="www.codeacademy.com">codeacademy</a> is setup perhaps that&rsquo;s one of my next adventures.</p>
